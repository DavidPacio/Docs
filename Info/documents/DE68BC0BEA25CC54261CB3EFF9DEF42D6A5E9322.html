From<br>Subject:  Semantic web to-do<br>Date:   Fri, 3 Aug 2018 12:18:02 +0200<br>From:   Marcell Nimfuehr <marcell@pacio.io><br><br>Our public info on semantic data has to follow a certain structure. It goes like this:<br><br>1. How is the situation today?<br>2. What’s the problem with the status quo?<br>3. What is the solution?<br>4. How will the solution be implemented?<br>5. What are the hurdles on the road?<br>6. How will the future look like when the solution is implemented?<br><br>The wp doesn’t answer these questions in layman’s terms. That’s why we need more text. These are a few specific questions that should fill the above structure.<br><br>1.  What kind of data are we talking about – real life examples?<br>2.  How is this data stored and exchanged today – explanation and examples?<br>3.  Where exactly is the problem today with this data?<br>4.  What are the consequences of the problem?<br>5.  Are there analogies for the problem?<br>6.  Who has tried this before and why did they fail?<br>7.  Did it fail because of the lack of Blockchain? What does Blockchain bring?<br>8.  How come that Pacio has a solution where everybody else failed or didn’t even try?<br>9.  Can we describe the Pacio solution from a birds-eye view (1 page) in laymen’s terms? Not the technical solution, but the organizational one?<br>10. What are the expected results of a functioning semantic web solution?<br>11. How might the process of universal use go? In which areas might it be used first, where are the areas that are the most difficult to enter?<br>12. Who are the actors of the current status quo with the described data and how will they have to change?<br>13. What does a data producer have to do to use SSIM? Example of an SMB as well as a big corp.<br><br>I have tried to study the subject to answer the questions like I did for TEA but I feel that I am failing. It is too big and I have too little knowhow to start with. It might take me days to find out I am on the wrong track and weeks to come up with good answers. So my suggestion is that whenever you have time, make an audio recording of your answers and we have Francisca type it. I guess that saves you and I time and speaking it makes it more accessible than written text. Then If you have links or bookchapters that give more background, please pass it along.<br>
